Transformers have no built‑in sense of order because each layer processes all tokens in parallel.  
To give the model a notion of *where* a token sits in a sentence, we add a **positional encoding** (PE) to the input embeddings.

1. **Shape and addition**  
   * Each token embedding is a vector of size `d_model`.  
   * The PE has the same size and is added element‑wise:  
     `h_t = x_t + PE_t`.  
   * Thus the network sees a combined “token + position” vector.

2. **Sine‑cosine construction**  
   For position `pos` and dimension index `i`  
   - even indices: `PE_{pos,2i}   = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_model})`  
   - odd indices:  `PE_{pos,2i+1} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_model})`  

   This pattern gives each dimension a distinct frequency.  
   *Why sine/cosine?*  
   They are continuous, bounded, and every position maps to a unique point in the space, yet any shift by a fixed offset `k` can be expressed as a linear combination of the original vectors.

3. **Relative‑position awareness**  
   Because a shift by `k` results in `PE_{pos+k}` that can be linearly derived from `PE_{pos}`, the self‑attention mechanism can learn to weigh tokens based on their relative distance.  
   For example, if the model wants to attend to the next word, it can learn a weight that depends on `PE_{pos+1}` – a vector predictable from `PE_{pos}`.

4. **Resulting benefits**  
   * The network can learn patterns that depend on order (e.g., “verb follows subject”).  
   * No recurrence or convolution is needed; the attention mechanism still receives the positional context.

In short, positional encodings give each token a unique, smoothly varying coordinate that lets the Transformer learn how token positions relate to one another, enabling sequential reasoning in a fully parallel architecture.",630

Transformers lack any inherent sense of order because their self‑attention mechanism treats every token equally.  
To give the model a notion of “where” each token sits, we add a *positional embedding* to the token embedding:

\[
PE_{(pos,2i)}   = \sin\!\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right),\qquad
PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \cos\!\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right)
\]

*Why sine & cosine?*  
- They generate a continuous, deterministic pattern that spans the full model dimension.  
- Different frequencies (controlled by \(10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}\)) ensure that every dimension contributes a unique phase.  
- For any fixed offset \(k\), the pair \((PE_{pos+k})\) can be expressed as a linear combination of \((PE_{pos})\) and \((PE_{k})\).  
  This linearity lets the dot‑product attention mechanism compute relative distances implicitly: the attention weight between positions \(i\) and \(j\) becomes a function of \(j-i\).

**Concrete example**  
Assume \(d_{\text{model}}=4\). For token “cat” at position 2:

\[
PE_{2} = \bigl[\sin(2/1),\, \cos(2/1),\, \sin(2/10000^{0.5}),\, \cos(2/10000^{0.5})\bigr].
\]

Add this vector to the 4‑dimensional word embedding of “cat” and feed the sum into the encoder.  
The attention layers now have access to a positional fingerprint; when a query vector from position 5 attends to a key from position 2, the dot product will incorporate the relative shift of 3 positions because the sinusoidal terms are shifted accordingly.

**Key nuances**  
- *Absolute vs. relative*: The sinusoidal design encodes absolute positions, but its linearity lets the model learn relative offsets via the attention scoring.  
- *Fixed vs. learned*: Sine/cosine are deterministic and allow extrapolation to longer sequences than seen during training. Learned positional embeddings are simpler but cannot extrapolate.  
- *Complexity*: Computing the encodings is \(O(1)\) per position, and adding them is just a vector addition—no extra trainable parameters.

Thus, positional encodings give the Transformer a mathematically elegant, parameter‑free way to keep track of sequence order, enabling it to process sequential data with only self‑attention.",1570

The positional encoding is a “where‑it‑is” tag that tells the model whether the word is first, second, etc.  

We compute the tag with sine and cosine waves of different lengths.  
If every word is shifted by the same number of steps, the new tag is just a linear change of the old one.  
That lets the model learn that “word 3 follows word 2” by looking at how the tag changes.

A Transformer looks at every word in a sentence all at once, so it has no idea which word comes first, second, etc.  
To give the model that information we add a small “position code” to each word’s representation.

1. **Create a code for each position** – for word 1 we make a set of numbers, for word 2 another set, and so on.  
2. **Use sine and cosine waves** – the numbers are built from sine and cosine functions that change at different speeds.  
   * Think of it like a fingerprint that changes smoothly from one word to the next.  
3. **Add the code to the word** – the position code is simply summed with the word’s own vector.  
4. **The model learns patterns** – because the code for position k can be expressed as a combination of the code for position k–1, the Transformer can learn relationships that depend on how far apart words are.

So, even though the Transformer never moves through the sentence step by step (no recurrence) and never slides a small window over it (no convolution), the added position codes give it a sense of order and distance, letting it understand who talks to whom in a sentence.",3790

At the bottom of both the encoder and decoder stacks, the token embedding \(x_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) is added to a positional vector \(p_{t}\).  
These vectors are constructed with sinusoidal functions:

\[
p_{t,2i}   = \sin\!\Bigl(\frac{t}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\Bigr),\qquad
p_{t,2i+1} = \cos\!\Bigl(\frac{t}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\Bigr),

\[
p_{t+k} = A_k\,p_{t} + B_k,
\]

with constants \(A_k,B_k\) that depend only on \(k\).  
Thus, when self‑attention compares two tokens, the dot‑product can exploit the relative position encoded in the summed vectors, allowing the model to learn to attend “left‑to‑right” or “right‑to‑left” without needing recurrent connections or convolutions.

Because the layers are fully parallel and there is no hidden state that carries a “time” dimension, the model would be blind to word order.  
**Positional encodings (PE) solve this by giving each token a unique vector that encodes its position.**

The paper adds the PE to the input embedding \(x_{t}\) before the first encoder (or decoder) layer:

\[
h_{t}^{(0)} = x_{t} + \text{PE}_{t}\;,
\]

where \(t\) is the absolute position.  
The PE vector has the same dimensionality \(d_{\text{model}}\) as the embedding so that the two can be summed.  

### Why sine / cosine functions?

For even dimensions \(2i\):

\[
\text{PE}_{t,2i}   = \sin\!\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right),
\]
and for odd dimensions \(2i+1\):

\[
\text{PE}_{t,2i+1} = \cos\!\left(\frac{t}{10000^{\,2i/d_{\text{model}}}}\right).
\]

The different frequencies make each dimension oscillate at a distinct rate.  
Because sine and cosine satisfy linear relationships, any fixed offset \(k\) can be expressed as a linear function of the encodings:

\[
\text{PE}_{t+k} = \mathbf{A}_{k}\,\text{PE}_{t} + \mathbf{b}_{k},
\]

so the attention mechanism can infer **relative position** by learning weights that depend on the difference between two position vectors.  
In practice, a query–key dot product that includes the PE term lets the model reward “closer” positions according to the learned pattern.

### Advantages and nuances

* **Smooth generalization** – the continuous sinusoidal form allows the model to extrapolate to longer sequences than seen during training.  
* **No additional learnable parameters** – the PE is fixed, keeping the network compact.  
* **Alternative learned PE** – many implementations replace the fixed schedule with a learnable embedding; this can be more expressive but may overfit and lose the linearity property.

### Quick analogy

Think of each word as a point on a spiral. Adding the PE gives it a unique “address” along the spiral, so when the model looks at two points it can compute how far apart they are simply by comparing their addresses.

\[

\[

\]

i.e. a linear transformation of the encoding at \(pos\).  This linear relationship allows attention heads to learn to attend to relative positions directly from the dot‑product scores, without having to encode absolute positions explicitly.  

Adding the encoding to the token embeddings is a simple element‑wise sum, so no extra parameters are introduced and the operation is fully parallelisable.  The model can therefore learn positional biases through the attention mechanism itself, while still re‑using the same set of weights across all positions.  

**Trade‑offs**:  
* The sinusoidal scheme fixes the positional space; learned positional embeddings can adapt but are larger.  
* Linear relative‑positioning works well for short‑to‑medium sequences; for very long contexts more expressive relative‑bias terms (e.g., Transformer‑XL, relative position representations) are often preferred.

To know the order of words, we add **positional encodings** to the word vectors (embeddings) before the first layer.  

**What is a positional encoding?**  
It is a vector that tells the model “this token is at position *p* in the sentence.”  
The Transformer uses the same size for the encoding and the word embedding (d_model) so the two can simply be added together.

**How is it built?**  
For each position *p* and each dimension *i* of the vector we compute two values:

* `PE(p, 2i)   = sin(p / 10000^(2i/d_model))`
* `PE(p, 2i+1) = cos(p / 10000^(2i/d_model))`

The sine and cosine use different frequencies.  
Why? Because the pattern of sines/cosines lets the model learn a linear relationship between positions.  
If a token moves one step forward (offset *k*), its encoding changes in a predictable way: `PE(p+k)` is a linear function of `PE(p)`.  
The model can therefore compare relative distances—e.g., “word A is two steps before word B”—even though it never moves a cursor or slides a filter.

**What does the Transformer do with this information?**  
When attention is computed, each token’s embedding (word + position) is used.  
Tokens that are close in the sequence will have similar positional parts, influencing the attention weights.  
Thus the model “knows” order and distance without having any recurrent or convolutional mechanism.

Because sine and cosine are analytic, any relative shift \(k\) satisfies a linear recurrence: \(\text{PE}_{pos+k}=A_k\,\text{PE}_{pos}+B_k\) with constants \(A_k, B_k\).  Consequently, the dot‑product attention scores can capture relative positions through linear transformations, allowing the model to learn attention patterns that depend on token order without explicit recurrence.

This design offers several advantages:  
• **Global access** – every token can attend to all others, eliminating the locality constraints of convolution.  
• **Computational efficiency** – positional information is encoded in \(O(1)\) addition rather than dynamic updates.  
• **Frequency tuning** – the wide frequency spectrum provides both short‑ and long‑range cues, enabling the model to learn nuanced positional biases.

### Why combine them?

| Component | What it does | Benefit |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Residual connection** | Adds the original input back to the sub‑layer output | Keeps the gradient from vanishing; deep stacks of layers can be trained because the signal can flow directly through the shortcut. |

| **LayerNorm** | Normalizes the summed vector to have zero mean and unit variance | Stabilizes learning, speeds up convergence, and reduces sensitivity to weight scale. |

### Concrete picture

Imagine a deep stack of 6 encoder layers.  
Without shortcuts, the gradient that updates the first layer comes only through the chain of six sub‑layers—easily vanishing.  
With a residual shortcut, the gradient can bypass the sub‑layer entirely, arriving unchanged at the first layer, making training feasible.

| **LayerNorm** | Normalizes the summed activations across the feature dimension. It removes mean/variance shifts that arise during training, leading to faster convergence and more stable learning than batch norm in a sequence‑to‑sequence setting. |
| **Dropout before addition** | Regularizes the sub‑layer’s output. Since the residual is added afterward, the model learns to be robust to missing sub‑layer features. |

### Practical benefits

- **Improved gradient flow** → deeper networks converge more reliably.  
- **Faster convergence** → LayerNorm reduces internal covariate shift, so the optimizer can take larger steps.  
- **Stability across sequences** → Normalizing across features makes the model less sensitive to varying sequence lengths or token statistics.  
- **Regularization** → Dropout on the sub‑layer output discourages over‑reliance on any single attention head or feed‑forward neuron.

These combined techniques give the Transformer its characteristic training efficiency and ability to scale to large models.",1570

1. **Residual connection** – the sub‑layer first produces a new vector **S(x)**.  
   It then adds this back to the original input: **y = x + S(x)**.  
   This addition is the residual. It lets the model keep the raw signal while learning a change on top of it.  
   • **Why it helps:** During back‑propagation the gradient can flow straight through the addition, so very deep stacks of layers do not suffer from vanishing gradients.

1. **Residual connections (the “shortcut”)**  
   *What it does:*  
   - Take the data that enters a small block (the sub‑layer).  
   - Run it through the block (e.g., attention or a feed‑forward network).  
   - Add the original data back to the block’s output.  
   *Why it matters:*  
   - The block only needs to change the data a little.  
   - If the block learns nothing, the output stays the same as the input, so the network can still pass useful information forward.  
   - It lets the gradient (the learning signal) flow straight from the end of the network back to the start, which makes deep models train better.

2. **Layer normalization**  
   *What it does:*  
   - For each data example, look at all the numbers that come out of a block.  
   - Compute their average and how spread out they are.  
   - Scale and shift the numbers so that the average becomes 0 and the spread becomes 1.  
   *Why it matters:*  
   - It keeps the numbers in a predictable range, no matter how deep the network is.  
   - The model doesn’t have to “guess” what scale the next block expects.  
   - It speeds up training and reduces the chance of numbers getting too big or too small (which can hurt learning).

3. **Together**  
   - The shortcut adds the original signal, while layer norm keeps the added signal stable.  
   - The combination lets the Transformer go deep (many layers) without the training process getting stuck or blowing up.

1. **Residual connection**  
   For each sub‑layer (e.g., self‑attention or a feed‑forward block) the output is added to its input:  
   `y = x + Sublayer(x)`.  
   This shortcut lets the network learn a *residual* function (the difference between input and desired output). If the sub‑layer cannot help the network at first, the shortcut still passes the input unchanged, so the gradient can flow backward through the addition instead of vanishing through many layers.

2. **Layer normalization**  
   After the addition, the sum is normalized:  
   `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`.  
   LayerNorm computes mean and variance across the hidden dimension, then scales and shifts the result. It stabilizes activations across different training steps, independent of batch size, and keeps gradients from exploding or vanishing.

1. **Residual connection** (`x + …`) keeps the original input unchanged while adding the learned transformation.

   *Benefit:*  
   - Stabilizes training by keeping activations in a consistent range, regardless of batch size (unlike batch norm).  
   - Accelerates convergence and reduces sensitivity to learning‑rate choices.  

**Nuances**

- The order “Res → Drop → Add → LayerNorm” is crucial: normalizing after the residual prevents the scaling of the skip connection from skewing the mean/variance.  
- LayerNorm’s per‑token normalization helps when the sequence length varies, which is common in NLP tasks.  
- Residuals also aid interpretability: the output can be seen as a perturbation of the input, making debugging easier.

**Real‑world hint**  
When fine‑tuning on a small dataset, you can freeze the residuals and only train the sub‑layer weights; LayerNorm ensures the downstream layers still receive stable inputs.

\]

Dropout is applied to \(S(x)\) prior to the addition, ensuring the residual path remains intact for the gradient flow while still regularizing the sub‑layer output.

**Residuals** mitigate vanishing gradients in very deep stacks by allowing the identity mapping to propagate unchanged information across layers. This preserves the signal when the sub‑layer learns only small refinements, and it enables the stack to function as a series of incremental adjustments rather than a deep non‑linear transformation.

**LayerNorm** stabilizes the dynamic range of the residual sum across all positions. By centering and scaling the activations per token (as opposed to batch‑wise statistics), it removes internal covariate shift without relying on batch size. This accelerates convergence, allows higher learning rates, and reduces sensitivity to the initial distribution of residual weights. In the Transformer, where the same sub‑layer is reused across many layers, LayerNorm also aligns the scale of residuals, making deeper architectures trainable.

The combination also facilitates **gradient flow**: the identity path ensures gradients can bypass complex sub‑layer operations, while LayerNorm preserves the gradient magnitude. Together they allow the Transformer to stack dozens of layers (e.g., 24‑layer BERT) without degradation.

1. **Residual connection**  
   *What it is:* The Transformer takes the input vector *x* of a sub‑layer (self‑attention or feed‑forward) and adds it to the sub‑layer’s output.  
   *Why it helps:* Imagine you are building a tower of blocks. If you always start each new block on a small foundation that already contains the previous block, the tower stays stable. Adding the original input keeps the “signal” from getting lost, so gradients (the information that tells the network how to adjust) can travel easily through many layers.

2. **Layer normalization**  
   *What it is:* After the residual addition, the sum is normalized: its mean and variance are computed across the features, and the result is scaled and shifted.  
   *Why it helps:* Different layers can produce values of wildly different sizes, which makes training hard. Normalization forces the activations into a consistent range, making the network’s learning smoother and faster.

3. **Dropout inside the sub‑layer**  
   Dropout randomly turns off some of the sub‑layer’s output units before the residual addition. This prevents the model from becoming too dependent on any single path and improves generalization.

1. **Residual Connection**

   This short‑circuit bypass lets gradients flow directly through the network, alleviating vanishing/exploding gradients and enabling the training of very deep stacks (the “deep” in “transformer” is practical because of this).

2. **Layer Normalization**  
   Immediately after the addition, the sum is normalized per‑sample:  
   \[
   \text{LayerNorm}(y) = \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma}\gamma + \beta
   \]  
   where \(\mu,\sigma\) are the mean and standard deviation of the elements in \(y\), and \(\gamma,\beta\) are learned affine parameters.  
   * **Stabilization** – Normalization removes internal covariate shift, keeping activations in a consistent range, which speeds up convergence.  
   * **Pre‑ vs Post‑Norm** – The original Transformer used *post‑norm* (norm after the residual). Later work found *pre‑norm* (norm before the sub‑layer) to be more stable for very deep stacks, but both variants preserve the same principle: normalize the signal before it feeds the next sub‑layer.

* The residual term (`x + …`) preserves a direct gradient path from the loss to earlier layers, mitigating vanishing‑gradient issues in deep stacks (≈50 layers).  
* LayerNorm normalizes over the hidden dimension per example, making the distribution of activations stationary across layers and training steps, which accelerates convergence and reduces sensitivity to initialization.

**Why the two are paired**

1. **Stabilized gradients** – The shortcut bypasses the potentially stiff non‑linearities of the sub‑layer, ensuring a smooth backward signal.  
2. **Normalized residuals** – Applying LayerNorm after the addition removes the need for post‑layer scaling, allowing the sub‑layer to learn an “identity‑plus‑delta” mapping without altering variance.

**Benefits**

- **Faster convergence**: LayerNorm’s per‑example normalization speeds up training and allows higher learning rates.  
- **Robustness to depth**: Residuals enable very deep Transformer stacks without degradation, a property proven in language and vision tasks.  
- **Regularization**: Dropout on the sub‑layer output before addition injects stochasticity into the residual path, reducing over‑fitting.  
- **Compatibility with weight‑tied and adaptive‑softmax settings**: The combination works seamlessly across varied vocabularies and model sizes.

**Nuanced points**

- The order of operations matters: `LayerNorm(x + dropout(sublayer(x)))` is preferred over pre‑norm; the latter yields a slightly different dynamics and has been studied for improved training stability in very deep models.  
- Recent variants (e.g., RAdam, Adafactor) pair well with this scheme, as the normalized gradients are more amenable to adaptive optimizers.  
- In cross‑modal Transformers (e.g., CLIP, ViLBERT), residuals help fuse modalities by allowing each sub‑layer to preserve modality‑specific information while gradually integrating it.

3. **Scaling** – Divide by \(\sqrt{d_k}\):

### Why the scaling factor matters

* **Magnitude control** – Without scaling, dot products grow roughly linearly with *dₖ*. For large *dₖ*, the values can be in the tens or hundreds, pushing the softmax into its “saturation” regime where its gradient ≈ 0.  
* **Training stability** – Small gradients make it hard for the network to learn useful attention patterns. Scaling forces the scores into a range where softmax has a meaningful slope (≈ 0.1 – 0.3).  
* **Uniform behavior across models** – All Transformer layers share the same softmax implementation. The √dₖ factor normalizes across different embedding sizes, allowing a single hyperparameter set to work whether *dₖ* = 64, 128, or 512.

**Illustrative example**  
With *dₖ* = 4:  
- Raw dot product of a query and key might be 10.  
- Scaling gives 10 / 2 = 5.  
- Softmax on 5 yields a probability ≈ 0.91 for that key, keeping the gradient sizable.  
If *dₖ* = 16 and we didn’t scale: 10 / 1 = 10 → softmax ≈ 0.9999, gradient ≈ 0, and the model cannot adjust that attention weight.",1570

1. **What it does**  
   - Each word in a sentence is represented by three vectors:  
     *Query (Q)* – what the word is looking for,  
     *Key (K)* – what each word offers,  
     *Value (V)* – the actual information (e.g., the word itself).  
   - To decide how much one word should pay attention to another, we compare its Q with every K.  
   - The comparison is a *dot product*: a simple multiplication‑and‑sum of their coordinates.  
   - The result is a list of scores – one for each word.

2. **Turning scores into weights**  
   - The raw scores can be large.  
   - We feed them into **softmax**: a math trick that turns any list of numbers into probabilities that add up to 1.  
   - These probabilities become *attention weights*.

3. **Combining the information**  
   - Each weight tells us how much to take from the corresponding V.  
   - The final output for a word is the weighted sum of all Vs.  
   - In matrix form: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d_k) · V`.

4. **Why the scaling factor (1/√d_k) matters**  
   - `d_k` is the number of dimensions in Q and K.  
   - As `d_k` grows, the raw dot products become larger (about √d_k times larger).  
   - Large numbers make softmax output almost 0 or 1, leaving very small gradients for learning.  
   - Dividing by √d_k keeps the scores in a moderate range, so the softmax stays in its “sweet spot” and learning remains effective.

**Quick analogy**  
Imagine each word is a student asking for help (Q). Other students (K) hold clues (V). If everyone shouts loudly (large dot product), the teacher (softmax) can’t hear any nuance. The scaling factor is like a mic‑volume knob that keeps the voices at a level the teacher can process well.",2710

The scaling factor 1/sqrt(d_k) is used to counteract the effect of large dot-product magnitudes when d_k is large, which can push the softmax function into regions with very small gradients.","How does the Transformer’s scaled dot-product attention work, and why is the scaling factor important?","**Scaled dot‑product attention (in a Transformer)**  
Think of a Transformer as a big table of numbers.  
- **Queries** (what we’re looking for) are in one column.  
- **Keys** (what is available) are in another column.  
- **Values** (the actual data we want to keep) are in a third column.  

The Transformer looks at every query and every key. It does a simple multiplication (dot product) for each pair.  
If a query matches a key well, the product is big; if not, it’s small.

**Why divide by a square root?**  
The dimension of the vectors (how many numbers each query/key has) can be large (e.g., 512).  
When you multiply many numbers together, the result can become very large, making the next step—the softmax—behave badly: the softmax will output almost 0 or almost 1, so learning gets stuck.  
Dividing by √(dimension) shrinks the numbers, keeping them in a range where the softmax works nicely and gradients (the signals that let the model learn) stay strong.

**Putting it together**  
1. Multiply every query by every key → a big table of raw scores.  
2. Scale the table by 1/√(dimension).  
3. Turn each row of the table into probabilities with softmax (so the row adds to 1).  
4. Weight the values by those probabilities and add them up.  

The final result is a weighted mix of the values, where the weights reflect how well each key matches the query. This is the “attention” that lets the Transformer focus on the most relevant pieces of information.",3790

The raw similarity between a query and all keys is the dot product: **Q Kᵀ**.  
Because the elements of Q and K are typically drawn from a normal distribution with unit variance, the expected magnitude of a dot product grows with the dimensionality *d_k* (≈ √ *d_k*).  
If we pass these large scores to softmax, the exponentials become extremely flat, pushing the output distribution into a region of vanishing gradients.  
To keep the scores in a useful range we divide by √ *d_k*:  

\[
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\operatorname{softmax}\!\Big(\frac{QK^{\top}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Big)\!V
\]

The scaling normalizes the variance of the dot products to about 1, so softmax operates near its linear regime, preserving gradients during back‑propagation.  
In practice, the entire operation is batched; the matrix product QKᵀ produces a *seq × seq* similarity matrix, softmax normalizes each row, and the weighted sum with V yields the context‑aware representation.  
Thus the scaling factor is a simple, yet critical, trick that stabilises training of deep transformer stacks.",4640

1. **Matrices**  
   - **Q** (queries), **K** (keys), **V** (values) are all \(n\times d_k\) or \(n\times d_v\) matrices, where \(n\) is the number of positions in a sequence.  
2. **Raw similarity**  
   - Compute the similarity between every query and every key:  
     \[
     S = QK^\top \quad (n\times n)
     \]  
   - \(S_{ij}\) is the dot product between query \(i\) and key \(j\).  
3. **Scaling**  
   - Divide by \(\sqrt{d_k}\):  
     \[
     \tilde S = \frac{S}{\sqrt{d_k}}
     \]  
   - Why? As \(d_k\) grows, the dot products become large in magnitude, pushing the softmax into its low‑gradient tails. Scaling keeps the values near zero, preserving sensitivity to small differences.  
4. **Weights**  
   - Apply softmax row‑wise:  
     \[
     A = \text{softmax}(\tilde S) \quad (n\times n)
     \]  
   - Each row sums to 1; \(A_{ij}\) is the attention weight that query \(i\) pays to value \(j\).  
5. **Weighted sum**  
   - Multiply by values:  
     \[
     O = AV \quad (n\times d_v)
     \]  
   - \(O_i\) is the output vector for position \(i\).  

**Why the scaling matters**

- **Gradient stability**: Unscaled dot products grow with \(d_k\), making the softmax output almost 0 or 1. Small changes in \(S\) produce negligible gradient flow, hindering learning.  
- **Numerical precision**: Large exponentials in softmax can overflow. Scaling reduces the exponent magnitude.  
- **Consistent behavior across layers**: Since all attention heads use the same scale, deeper layers don’t need separate hyper‑parameters to handle varying key dimensionalities.

**Quick illustration**  
For a 4‑token sentence, \(Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times 64}\).  
- Compute \(S = QK^\top\) → \(4\times4\) matrix.  
- Scale: \(\tilde S = S / 8\).  
- Softmax each row → 4 weight vectors.  
- Multiply by \(V\) → 4 output embeddings that blend information from all tokens, weighted by relevance.

Given matrices of queries \(Q\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d_k}\), keys \(K\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d_k}\) and values \(V\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d_v}\), the Transformer computes

\[
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\operatorname{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^{\!\top}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V .
\]

* **Dot‑product stage** – \(QK^{\top}\) produces the raw similarity logits between each query and all keys.  
* **Temperature scaling** – division by \(\sqrt{d_k}\) acts as a temperature parameter, normalising the logits’ variance.  
* **Softmax** – turns the scaled logits into a probability distribution over keys, yielding a weighted sum of values via matrix multiplication with \(V\).

**Why the scaling factor matters**

If \(d_k\) is large, the dot products have variance \(\approx d_k\) (assuming zero‑mean, unit‑variance embeddings). Unscaled logits quickly grow, pushing the softmax into the saturation regime where its gradient \(\nabla_{\text{softmax}} \approx \mathbf{0}\). Consequently, learning signals through the attention weights vanish, slowing or preventing convergence.

Scaling by \(\sqrt{d_k}\) keeps the logits’ variance near one, analogous to a temperature of 1. It preserves the magnitude of the softmax gradients, stabilises training, and maintains a richer, less sparse attention distribution. This is critical when stacking many Transformer layers and employing multi‑head attention, where each head operates at different scales of \(d_k\).

**Broader implications**

The scaling trick is a form of *temperature annealing* that balances expressivity and numerical stability. It is also a key factor in the success of the *Transformer* architecture across NLP, vision, and multimodal tasks, as it ensures that multi‑head attention can learn useful, non‑trivial weight patterns without premature saturation.",6010

   * **Keys** (K): tags that describe each token.  
   * **Values** (V): the actual information we want to mix.  
   Each is a matrix (many tokens at once).  

2. **How it works**  
   * Compute a score for every query‑key pair by taking their dot product (a single number that tells how similar they are).  
   * Divide each score by √(dₖ) – this is the **scaling factor**.  
   * Pass the scaled scores through a softmax. This turns them into probabilities (weights) that sum to 1.  
   * Multiply the V matrix by these weights and add the results. The output is a weighted blend of values, where the blend reflects how well each key matches the query.  

3. **Why the scaling factor matters**  
   * Dot products grow with the dimension dₖ. If dₖ is large, the raw scores become big, pushing the softmax into a very sharp, almost one‑hot distribution.  
   * That sharpness means tiny changes in the scores produce almost no change in the weights – the gradient becomes tiny, making learning slow or unstable.  
   * Dividing by √(dₖ) keeps the scores in a moderate range (around ±1), so the softmax stays in a useful region where gradients are sizeable and training is efficient.

To keep the logits in a regime where the softmax has useful gradients, we divide by \(\sqrt{d_k}\):  

\[
\alpha = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)

The attention output is then \(\alpha V\).  
The scaling counteracts the fact that as \(d_k\) grows, dot‑products concentrate around zero but with variance \(d_k\); unscaled scores can saturate the softmax, yielding near‑zero gradients and hampering learning.

---

### Why the scaling matters

* **Variance control**: Each element of \(QK^\top\) is a sum of \(d_k\) independent dot‑product terms. Its variance scales linearly with \(d_k\). Dividing by \(\sqrt{d_k}\) normalises the variance to roughly 1, preventing the logits from growing unbounded as the model depth and dimensionality increase.

* **Softmax sensitivity**: When logits are large, the softmax saturates; its gradient approaches zero. With scaled logits, the softmax remains in a regime where gradients are meaningful, enabling stable back‑propagation through many attention layers.

* **Temperature interpretation**: The scaling is equivalent to setting a temperature \(T=1/\sqrt{d_k}\). A smaller \(T\) sharpens the distribution; a larger \(T\) smooths it. The chosen temperature balances selective attention (focus on a few keys) against gradient flow.

---

### Practical implications

* **Training stability**: Without scaling, deep Transformers (e.g., >10 layers) often fail to converge due to vanishing gradients in the attention sub‑layer.

* **Model capacity**: The scaling allows the use of high‑dimensional key/query spaces (e.g., \(d_k=512\) or 1024) without the risk of softmax saturation, thus leveraging richer representations.

* **Extensions**: Some variants replace the fixed scaling with a learnable temperature or a layer‑wise schedule, trading off flexibility against the simplicity and proven stability of the fixed \(1/\sqrt{d_k}\) factor.

In short, the scaling factor is a simple yet critical design choice that keeps the attention mechanism numerically well‑behaved and trainable across the wide range of transformer architectures.",9840

1. **Embedding + Positional Encoding**  
   Each token in the input sentence is first mapped to a dense vector (embedding). Because the transformer has no recurrence, we add a positional encoding vector to each embedding so the model knows where each word sits in the sequence.

2. **Layer Stack (N = 6)**  
   The encoder is a stack of 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub‑layers:

   *a. Multi‑head self‑attention*  
   - For every token, the model computes three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).  
   - Attention scores are `softmax(Q·Kᵀ / √d_k)`, giving a weight for every pair of tokens.  
   - The weighted sum of the V vectors produces an updated representation that mixes information from all positions.

   *b. Position‑wise feed‑forward network*  
   - Two linear layers with a ReLU in between (`W₂·ReLU(W₁·x + b₁) + b₂`).  
   - Applied independently to each token’s vector.

3. **Residual + LayerNorm**  
   After each sub‑layer the output is added to its input (`x + Sublayer(x)`) and then normalized (`LayerNorm`). Dropout is applied to the sub‑layer output before addition.

**Why repeat the layers?**

- **Progressive abstraction:**  
  The first layer learns low‑level patterns (e.g., word similarities). Each subsequent layer can combine those patterns to form higher‑level concepts (e.g., phrase structure).

- **Depth‑wise refinement:**  
  Deeper layers can re‑weight attention based on richer context, allowing the model to capture long‑range dependencies that early layers might miss.

- **Capacity without recurrence:**  
  Because attention operates on the whole sequence at once, stacking layers gives the model a larger “receptive field” without sequential processing, improving performance on complex tasks.

2. **Multi‑head self‑attention** – for every head the query, key, and value matrices are computed. Attention weights (softmax(QKᵀ/√d)) give each token a weighted sum of all tokens, allowing the model to gather context from the whole sequence. The outputs of all heads are concatenated and projected back to the model dimension.  
3. **Residual + LayerNorm** – the attention output is added to its input (residual) and then normalised: `LayerNorm(x + Attention(x))`. This stabilises gradients and preserves the original signal.  
4. **Feed‑forward network** – a position‑wise two‑layer MLP (`ReLU(W₁·x + b₁)·W₂ + b₂`) is applied independently to each token, expanding the representation to a larger hidden dimension and then projecting back.  
5. **Dropout** – applied after the attention and feed‑forward sub‑layers to regularise.  
6. **Repeat** – steps 2–5 are stacked six times. Each successive layer sees a more abstract, context‑rich representation. Earlier layers capture local patterns; deeper layers integrate long‑range dependencies and higher‑order semantics, enabling the encoder to produce a hierarchy of features that downstream decoders can exploit.  

**Key nuances**  
- Residual + LayerNorm keeps training stable across many layers.  
- The depth (N=6) balances expressiveness with computational cost; too few layers limit context integration, too many risk overfitting or vanishing gradients.

3. **Run through 6 identical blocks** – Every block does the same two things:  

   * **Self‑attention** – Each word looks at every other word and decides how much it should pay attention to them. Think of it like a group discussion where everyone listens to each other.  
   * **Feed‑forward network** – A small neural network that tweaks each word’s vector separately.  

   After each sub‑step we use a *residual connection* (add the original input back) and *layer normalization* (scale the numbers). Drop‑out is applied to help the model generalise.  

4. **Result** – After the 6 blocks, each word’s vector contains a richer, more abstract description of the sentence.

**Why many layers?**  
- Each layer is like a filter that learns a new way to combine the words.  
- Early layers capture simple patterns (e.g., “cat” is a noun).  
- Later layers combine those patterns to recognise more complex ideas (e.g., “cat sat on the mat” describes an action).  
- Stacking layers lets the model gradually build higher‑level representations, just like adding layers to a cake gives it more depth.

   1. **Multi‑head self‑attention**  
      - For each token the model creates three vectors: *query*, *key*, and *value*.  
      - Attention scores are computed as \(\text{softmax}(QK^\top / \sqrt{d})\).  
      - These scores weight the values; each head learns a different “view” of the context.  
      - The outputs of all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed.  
      - Result → \( \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{Attn}(x)) \).

   2. **Feed‑forward network**  
      - A position‑wise two‑layer MLP: \( \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2 \).  
      - Again added to the input of the sub‑layer and normalized:  
        \( \text{LayerNorm}(x_{\text{attn}} + \text{FFN}(x_{\text{attn}})) \).

   3. **Dropout** is applied after each sub‑layer to prevent over‑fitting.

3. **Why many layers?**  
   - The first layer learns low‑level relations (e.g., local word co‑occurrences).  
   - Deeper layers compose these relations into higher‑level abstractions (e.g., phrases, sentence structure).  
   - Stacking six identical layers lets the model capture increasingly complex patterns while keeping the architecture uniform and trainable.

1. **Input**: Token embeddings + learned positional encodings.  
2. **Self‑attention sub‑layer**  
   - Computes query‑key‑value triples per head.  
   - Attention weights: \(\text{softmax}(QK^T/√d_k)\).  
   - Aggregates values: \(\sum \alpha_i V_i\).  
   - Multi‑head concatenation + linear projection.  
3. **Feed‑forward sub‑layer**  
   - Two linear transforms with GELU (or ReLU) in between:  
     \(FF(x)=W_2\,\text{GELU}(W_1x+b_1)+b_2\).  
4. **Residual‑+‑LayerNorm** (post‑norm convention)  
   - \(y=\text{LayerNorm}(x+\text{Dropout}(\text{Sublayer}(x)))\).  
   - Stabilizes gradients, allows very deep stacks.  

**Role of repeated layers**  
- **Hierarchical abstraction**: Each layer’s output is a richer representation; higher layers capture long‑range, global patterns that lower layers cannot.  
- **Compositionality**: Self‑attention couples all positions; stacking lets the network form multi‑step dependencies (e.g., subject‑verb agreement, coreference).  
- **Capacity scaling**: Depth increases expressiveness more efficiently than width for sequence modeling; empirically a 6‑layer stack balances training stability and performance.  
- **Residual flow**: The skip connections preserve the raw input signal, mitigating vanishing‑gradient issues and enabling deeper networks without degrading lower‑level information.  
- **Layer‑norm positioning**: Post‑norm gives better training dynamics for very deep encoders; pre‑norm variants can further improve optimization but alter convergence characteristics.

**Broader connections**  
- **Attention‑only modeling** replaces recurrent or convolutional inductive biases, yielding order‑agnostic representations that still respect relative positions via encodings.  
- **Depth‑wise vs width‑wise trade‑off**: In Transformers, increasing depth often yields diminishing returns compared to adding heads or hidden size; hence a moderate depth (≈6) is common in practice.

1. **Input preparation**  
   - Each token in the sequence is mapped to a dense vector (embedding).  
   - A positional encoding is added to the embedding so the model knows the order of tokens.  
   - The sum of these two vectors is the input \(x_0\) to the first encoder layer.

2. **Layer structure**  
   Each of the 6 identical layers contains two sub‑layers:

   a. **Multi‑head self‑attention**  
      - Every token attends to every other token, producing a context‑aware representation.  
      - The result is added back to the original input of this sub‑layer (residual connection) and then normalized (LayerNorm).  
      - Dropout is applied to the output.

   b. **Feed‑forward network**  
      - A position‑wise fully‑connected network (two linear layers with a ReLU in between).  
      - Again a residual connection, LayerNorm, and dropout are applied.

   The output of the second sub‑layer becomes the input \(x_{l+1}\) for the next layer.

3. **Why many layers?**  
   - Each layer refines the representation: the first layer captures local interactions, the next one captures larger‑scale patterns, and so on.  
   - With 6 layers, the encoder builds progressively more abstract features (e.g., “semantic sense of a phrase” after several layers).  
   - This depth allows the model to represent complex relationships without needing very large attention heads.

A Transformer layer contains an *attention* sub‑module that, for each token, looks at every other token and computes a weighted sum of their “value” vectors.  
The weighting is based on a similarity score between the token’s *query* vector and the *key* vectors of the other tokens.  

In **single‑head attention** the query, key and value vectors are all projected to the same hidden dimension (say `d_model`). The weighted sum is a single vector per token. Because there is only one set of projections, the model can learn only one kind of relationship at a time.

**Multi‑head attention** runs several of these attention sub‑modules in parallel – each called a *head*.  
- For head *i* the input embeddings are linearly projected to a lower dimension (`d_k`, `d_v`).  
- Each head learns its own linear maps for queries, keys, and values, so it can focus on a different type of relationship (e.g., syntactic, semantic, positional).  
- After computing the attention outputs for every head, the outputs are concatenated and projected back to the original `d_model` size.

**Why it helps**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Richer representation** | Each head captures a distinct pattern (e.g., “subject‑verb agreement” vs. “coreference”). The final concatenated vector contains all of these patterns. |
| **Parallel computation** | Heads run concurrently, keeping inference time roughly the same as a single head but with more expressive power. |
| **Robustness** | If one head overfits a spurious pattern, others can still encode the correct dependency, reducing error. |

### Why it outperforms a single head

| Property | Single‑head | Multi‑head |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Subspace specialization** | One projection mixes all relations, forcing a single “view” of the data. | Each head learns a distinct projection, allowing the model to attend to multiple linguistic or semantic sub‑patterns simultaneously. |
| **Expressive power** | Limited to a rank‑\(d_k\) linear map; struggles to capture complex, multi‑scale dependencies. | By concatenating \(H\) diverse sub‑maps (rank \(H\times d_k\)), the effective capacity grows while keeping each head lightweight. |
| **Gradient flow** | A single large projection can create bottlenecks; gradients must pass through one set of weights. | Parallel heads distribute the gradient, mitigating vanishing gradients and enabling better optimization. |
| **Parallelism** | Only one attention matrix must be computed. | All heads are computed in parallel; modern hardware (GPUs/TPUs) handles this efficiently, offsetting the extra matrix multiplications. |
| **Regularization** | A single head can overfit to idiosyncratic patterns. | The diversity of heads acts as an implicit ensemble, improving generalization. |

In practice, multi‑head attention lets Transformers model relationships like syntactic role, coreference, and long‑distance dependencies in separate subspaces, leading to higher accuracy on NLP benchmarks. The trade‑off is a modest increase in parameters and compute, which modern accelerators comfortably absorb.",1570

In a Transformer, “attention” lets the model look at a sentence and decide which words are most useful for predicting another word.  
- **Query** = the word we want to improve.  
- **Key** = each word in the sentence.  
- **Value** = the information carried by that word.  

For a single head, the model makes one set of queries, keys, and values, then averages their influence.  
Multi‑head attention splits this into several independent “heads.”  
Each head learns its own small set of queries, keys, and values (using a tiny linear transformation).  
All heads run at the same time, then the results are glued together and turned back into one vector.

**Why is it better than one head?**  
1. **Different viewpoints** – Each head can focus on a different pattern (e.g., subject‑verb agreement, synonym use, or long‑distance connections).  
2. **Richer information** – The final vector contains a mix of many perspectives, giving the model a fuller picture.  
3. **Parallelism** – Heads work simultaneously, keeping the model fast.  
4. **Avoids over‑averaging** – With one head, useful signals can cancel each other. Multiple heads keep them separate until the final combination.

2. **Compare the resized words** to decide how much each word should influence another.  
3. **Collect the important parts** (values) and keep them.  

After all the heads finish, the model stitches their results together and reshapes the final picture.

- **Richer understanding:** Combining many small views lets the model notice subtle patterns (e.g., a word’s role in different contexts).

### Why multi‑head beats single‑head

| **Expressiveness** | One subspace, limited to a single set of dependencies | H distinct subspaces, each can capture different linguistic or visual patterns |
| **Parallelism** | Serial attention over all positions | All heads process in parallel, reducing sequential bottlenecks |

| **Robustness** | Vulnerable to spurious correlations in Q‑K dot products | Averaging over heads decorrelates attention patterns, improving generalization |
| **Interpretability** | Single heat‑map | Multiple heat‑maps reveal distinct “roles” (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic) |

Thus, multi‑head attention enriches the model’s capacity to learn intricate, multi‑facet dependencies while preserving computational efficiency and improving optimization dynamics.",6730

For a sequence of hidden vectors \(H\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\), each head \(h\) learns three linear maps  

\[
Q_h = HW_h^Q,\;\; K_h = HW_h^K,\;\; V_h = HW_h^V,
\]

with \(W_h^Q,K_h,V_h\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d_k}\) (for queries/keys) and \(W_h^V\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d_v}\).  
Scaled dot‑product attention is then computed per head:

\[

\]

The outputs of all \(H\) heads are concatenated and linearly projected once more to restore dimension \(d\). This yields the final per‑token representation.

### Why multi‑head is better than single‑head

| Aspect | Single‑head | Multi‑head |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Subspace coverage** | Projects queries, keys, values into a single \(d_k\)‑dim space; different linguistic or semantic patterns are forced into the same representation. | Each head has its own \(d_k\)‑dim subspace, allowing the model to attend to multiple relational patterns (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic) in parallel. |
| **Expressive capacity** | One attention matrix can only capture a single weighted dependency pattern per position, limiting the richness of learned interactions. | With \(H\) heads the model can simultaneously encode \(H\) distinct patterns; concatenation aggregates them, increasing representational power without altering the overall dimensionality. |
| **Avoiding averaging** | A single attention head’s output is essentially an average over all relevant positions, potentially smearing important signals. | Separate heads maintain specialized focus; the concatenation preserves each head’s unique information, mitigating information loss. |
| **Learning flexibility** | The single head must reconcile diverse signal types (e.g., distance vs. content), often requiring larger hidden sizes. | The head division naturally splits the learning load, reducing the need for huge per‑head dimensionality while still covering the full feature space. |
| **Regularization effect** | Single head can overfit a particular pattern, as there is no enforced diversity. | Independent heads encourage the model to distribute information across subspaces, which acts as a form of implicit regularization. |

### Trade‑offs

* **Computational cost**: \(O(H\,n^2\,d_k)\) operations versus \(O(n^2\,d_k)\) for a single head; however, modern GPUs handle parallel heads efficiently.  
* **Parameter overhead**: Each head adds its own weight matrices, but this is offset by the model’s increased capacity.  
* **Redundancy risk**: In practice, some heads learn similar patterns; pruning strategies (e.g., head‑importance weighting) can mitigate waste.

In summary, multi‑head attention empowers the Transformer to capture a richer, more nuanced set of dependencies by projecting onto multiple subspaces simultaneously, thereby overcoming the averaging bottleneck of single‑head designs while offering a manageable computational trade‑off.",7520

Using multiple heads enables the model to capture a richer set of dependencies.","What is multi-head attention in the Transformer, and why is it beneficial compared to single-head attention?","**Answer (Expert‑Level)**  
Multi‑head attention is the core of the Transformer’s ability to model relationships across a sequence in parallel. Formally, each head \(h\) applies learned linear projections \(W^Q_h, W^K_h, W^V_h\) to the input representations \(X\), producing queries \(Q_h = XW^Q_h\), keys \(K_h = XW^K_h\), and values \(V_h = XW^V_h\). The scaled‑dot‑product attention is then computed:

\[
\operatorname{Attn}_h(Q_h, K_h, V_h) = \operatorname{softmax}\!\left(\frac{Q_hK_h^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_h.
\]

The outputs of all \(H\) heads are concatenated and linearly transformed with \(W^O\) to yield the final context vector. This design preserves the total dimensionality \(d_{\text{model}}\) while letting each head operate in a distinct sub‑space of dimension \(d_k = d_{\text{model}}/H\). Consequently, the model can attend to multiple semantic or syntactic patterns simultaneously—e.g., a head may specialize in positional dependencies while another captures coreference.

**Benefits over single‑head:**
1. **Expressive power** – the joint sub‑space exploration enables the network to approximate a richer set of attention patterns than a single weighted average could capture.
2. **Parameter efficiency** – distributing parameters across heads allows learning diverse attention matrices without a proportional increase in overall parameter count.
3. **Regularization effect** – each head must learn a plausible attention distribution; this diversity reduces over‑fitting to spurious correlations.
4. **Facilitated gradient flow** – parallel heads create multiple pathways for information, easing optimization in deep stacks.

**Trade‑offs & nuances:**  
- **Dimensionality trade‑off**: reducing \(d_k\) per head can increase approximation error; choosing \(H\) balances model capacity and computational cost.
- **Head redundancy**: empirical studies show some heads learn similar patterns, suggesting architectural or regularization tweaks (e.g., head dropout) can improve utilization.
- **Computational overhead**: although parallelizable, memory consumption rises with \(H\). Efficient implementation uses fused kernels or tensor cores.

Thus, multi‑head attention is a principled way to enrich the Transformer’s relational reasoning while maintaining tractable complexity, a cornerstone for modern sequence models.",9840

|------|--------------|-----------------|

| 2. **Encoder‑decoder attention** | Lets the decoder use the encoder’s output to learn which words in the source sentence are relevant. | Couples the input (e.g., a French sentence) to the output (e.g., an English translation). |
| 3. **Feed‑forward network** | A small neural net applied to each position independently. | Adds extra non‑linear transformation. |

After each of these sub‑layers the output is added back to the input (a *residual connection*) and then normalized ( *layer norm* ) to keep the values stable.

**How the decoder guarantees “future‑proof” predictions**

1. **Masking** – In the first sub‑layer, every attention score that would point to a later word is set to a very large negative number (−∞).  
2. **Softmax** – The softmax function turns these scores into probabilities; a −∞ becomes 0.  
3. **Result** – The current word can only “listen” to words that appear before it, so the probability of the next word depends only on earlier context.

1. **Six identical blocks** – the whole decoder is just six copies of the same structure, stacked on top of each other.  
2. **Three sub‑steps in each block**  
   * **Self‑attention** – looks only at the words that have already appeared in the sentence being generated.  
   * **Encoder‑decoder attention** – looks at all the words the encoder has read (the source sentence).  
   * **Feed‑forward network** – a small neural net that mixes the information again.  

**Why earlier words only influence the next word**

* In the self‑attention part we add a *mask*.  
* The mask is a very large negative number (‑∞) for any pair of positions where the later word tries to look at a later word.  
* When the softmax (the step that turns scores into probabilities) sees this ‑∞, it turns that probability into 0, so the later word cannot “see” future words.  
* Thus, when the decoder predicts the 5th word, it can only use information from words 1–4, never from words 5–N.  

**Other helpful tricks**

* **Residual connections** – add the input of each sub‑step to its output, so gradients can flow easily.  
* **Layer normalization** – keeps the numbers in a good range so learning stays stable.

So, the decoder is a stack of six layers, each doing self‑attention (masked to keep only past words), encoder‑decoder attention, and a small network, all wrapped with residual links and normalization. This structure guarantees that every new prediction depends only on earlier positions.",3790

  3. **Position‑wise feed‑forward network** – a two‑layer MLP applied to every token independently.

- **Residual connections** wrap each sub‑layer, and **layer normalization** follows the addition, stabilising training.

**Why predictions depend only on earlier tokens**

During the first sub‑layer, a **causal mask** is applied to the attention weights. The mask sets every entry that would let a token look at a future position to \(-\infty\). After the softmax, these entries become zero, so the query can only “see” itself and earlier tokens. Because the subsequent encoder‑decoder attention and feed‑forward layers receive only the outputs of this masked sub‑layer, the final prediction for position *i* can never use information from positions > *i*.

*Example*: For a 4‑token target, the mask for the first layer looks like

```
[0  -∞  -∞  -∞]
[0   0  -∞  -∞]
[0   0   0  -∞]

**Ensuring causality (predictions depend only on earlier tokens)**  
During the masked self‑attention step a **causal mask** is applied to the attention logits before the softmax. The mask is a triangular matrix that sets all logits pointing to future positions to **–∞**. In practice this is done by adding a large negative constant (‑1e9) to those entries.

The first sub‑layer uses a **causal (look‑ahead) mask**: for position *i*, all positions *j > i* receive a logit of \(-\infty\).

A decoder layer contains three sequential sub‑layers, each wrapped in a residual connection followed by layer‑norm:

1. **Masked multi‑head self‑attention**  
   – Projects the previous decoder output into query, key, and value spaces.  
   – A causal mask \(M\) (all positions \(j>i\) set to \(-\infty\)) is added to the attention logits before the softmax:  
   \[
   \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M\right)
   \]
   – Guarantees that the representation of position \(i\) can attend only to positions \(\le i\).

2. **Encoder–decoder attention**  
   – Uses the same multi‑head mechanism, but keys and values come from the encoder stack, while queries come from the decoder’s previous sub‑layer.  
   – No mask is applied here; all encoder positions are reachable.

3. **Position‑wise feed‑forward network**  
   – Two linear transforms with a ReLU (or GELU) in between.

The stack of six such layers yields the full decoder.

**Ensuring causal predictions**  
The causal mask is applied only in the self‑attention sub‑layer; this is the sole source of temporal dependency. Because the softmax receives \(-\infty\) for illegal future indices, the attention weights for those positions become zero, preventing any information flow from future tokens. The residual and layer‑norm preserve the overall flow without altering the causal constraint. Thus, each output token is generated based solely on previously generated tokens and the encoder context.",9840

This means that we replace the hard 0 and 1 targets with values ε_ls/(K-1) and 1 - ε_ls, respectively, where K is the number of classes.

*What it does*  
When training a Transformer, the usual loss is cross‑entropy between the model’s predicted probability distribution and a *hard* target: 1 for the correct class and 0 for all others.  
Label smoothing replaces that hard vector with a *soft* one:

- For the correct class: \(1 - \varepsilon_{\text{ls}}\)  
- For every other class: \(\frac{\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}}{K-1}\)

With \(\varepsilon_{\text{ls}} = 0.1\) and, say, \(K=10\) classes, the target becomes 0.9 for the true class and 0.011 for each of the nine wrong classes.  

*Why it matters*  
1. **Regularization** – The model is penalised for becoming over‑confident. By never assigning probability 1, it learns to spread some mass over other plausible classes, which reduces over‑fitting to the training data.  
2. **Stability** – Sharp probability peaks can lead to exploding gradients or sudden jumps in training. Smoothing keeps the loss surface smoother, so gradients are more predictable.  
3. **Better generalization** – In machine‑translation tasks the Transformer’s BLEU score tends to improve, because the model captures the ambiguity in natural language better.  

*Typical effect*  
- Perplexity often drops slightly because the model is less prone to over‑commitment.  
- BLEU scores rise by a few points in practice.  
- The model learns to predict a small probability mass for plausible alternative tokens, which is useful for downstream tasks that need uncertainty estimates.

In short, label smoothing turns the hard 0/1 targets into a soft distribution that regularises the Transformer, leads to steadier training, and usually results in a modest but measurable boost in translation quality.",630

During training, each target token is normally represented by a one‑hot vector (1 for the correct class, 0 for all others). With label smoothing (ε_ls = 0.1) we replace these hard targets by a *soft* distribution:

- correct class → 1 − ε_ls = 0.9  
- each incorrect class → ε_ls/(K − 1) = 0.1/(K − 1)

where *K* is the vocabulary size.  

This technique has two main effects:

| Effect | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Regularization** | By preventing the model from assigning probability 1 to a single token, the logits are kept smaller and gradients are less extreme. This reduces overfitting and keeps the network from becoming overly confident. |
| **Calibration & Generalization** | The softened targets push the network to distribute mass over plausible alternatives. In sequence tasks this often yields better perplexity and higher BLEU scores because the model learns to be more tolerant of small token‑level ambiguities. |

In practice, label smoothing slightly increases the training loss (since the targets are less “sharp”), but the validation perplexity and downstream BLEU typically improve, especially in low‑data regimes.

When a Transformer is trained, it learns to predict a word from a list of possible words.
Normally the correct word is marked as “1” (yes) and every other word as “0” (no).
Label smoothing changes these hard 0-and-1 marks into softer numbers:

- The right word gets a value slightly less than 1 (e.g., 0.9 if ε = 0.1).
- All the wrong words get a tiny positive value (e.g., 0.01 each if there are 10 words).

**Why do this?**
1. **Prevents overconfidence** – The model won’t latch too tightly onto one answer, helping avoid overfitting.
2. **Acts as gentle regularization** – Encourages the model to keep plausible alternatives in mind.
3. **Improves BLEU and generalization** – Often boosts translation quality metrics.

**In practice:**
- Example: predicting “cat.” With hard labels → 1 for cat, 0 for others. With smoothing → 0.9 for cat, 0.01 for each other word.
- The loss now penalizes being *too* sure, producing more calibrated probability outputs.

**Takeaway:** Label smoothing slightly softens training targets, keeping the Transformer flexible and better performing on new data, with modest BLEU gains as a bonus.",3790

Label smoothing replaces the hard one‑hot targets (0 or 1) with “soft” labels:

\[
y_{\text{soft}} =
\begin{cases}
1-\varepsilon_{\text{ls}} & \text{for the true class} \\
\displaystyle\frac{\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}}{K-1} & \text{for every other class}
\end{cases}
\]

where \(K\) is the vocabulary size and \(\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}\) (here 0.1) controls the amount of smoothing.  
Instead of telling the model “this token is absolutely correct,” we say “this token is 90 % likely, and the rest share the remaining 10 %.”  

### Why it matters
* **Reduces over‑confidence** – A model that predicts probabilities close to 1.0 for a single class tends to be brittle. Smoothing forces the logits to be less extreme, encouraging the network to learn more robust decision boundaries.
* **Acts as regularization** – By softening targets, the training objective penalizes confident wrong predictions less harshly, which is analogous to adding a small noise to the labels. This discourages the model from memorizing training data idiosyncrasies.
* **Improves generalization** – In practice, transformers trained with label smoothing often achieve higher BLEU scores on translation tasks because they generalize better to unseen sentences.
* **Stabilizes training** – With softer targets, gradients are less peaked, which can make the optimization landscape smoother and help the optimizer converge more reliably.

### Practical impact
* **Training loss**: Cross‑entropy with smoothed labels yields a slightly higher training loss, but this reflects a more realistic assessment of confidence.
* **Prediction distribution**: Softmax outputs are more spread out; the model is less “sure” about its top prediction, which can help downstream tasks that rely on uncertainty estimates.
* **Fine‑tuning**: When transferring a pre‑trained Transformer, one can adjust \(\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}\) to control how much the model should trust the new data versus its prior knowledge.

In short, label smoothing injects a small, controlled amount of “mistake” into the labels. This regularization technique keeps the Transformer from becoming over‑confident, leading to better generalization and higher BLEU scores on translation benchmarks.",4640

Label smoothing replaces the hard 0/1 targets in the cross‑entropy loss with soft targets:

- For the true class \(y\): \(p_y = 1-\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}\)  
- For every other class: \(p_k = \varepsilon_{\text{ls}}/(K-1)\)

With \(\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}=0.1\) and, say, \(K=5\), the target for the correct token becomes 0.90 while each incorrect token gets 0.025.

**Why we do it**

1. **Regularization** – By never allowing the model to assign probability 1 to any token, we dampen over‑confident predictions that often arise from noisy data or a too‑strong fit to the training set.
2. **Sharper probability distribution** – The model learns to spread its confidence, which improves the *soft* predictions that downstream metrics (e.g., BLEU) rely on.
3. **Better generalization** – Empirically, Transformer models trained with label smoothing show lower perplexity on validation data and higher BLEU scores on unseen text.

**Practical effects**

- **Reduced over‑fitting**: The loss landscape becomes smoother, leading to more stable gradients and faster convergence.
- **Improved translation quality**: The softened targets encourage the decoder to consider alternative tokens, reducing “hallucinations” and improving beam‑search outcomes.
- **Trade‑offs**: A too‑large \(\varepsilon_{\text{ls}}\) can under‑train the model, causing higher perplexity; a very small value offers little regularization.

**Quick example**

If the Transformer predicts “the cat sat” on a sentence with five tokens, the loss calculation will penalize the model for assigning 1.0 to the correct token and 0.0 to the others. With smoothing, the penalty is applied to a 0.90/0.025 distribution, encouraging the model to be less sure about a single token and more aware of alternatives.

**Why it matters**

1. **Regularization** – By preventing the model from assigning probability 1 to a token, the network learns to keep its logits more spread out. This combats over‑confidence, which is common in language models that otherwise produce overly sharp distributions.

2. **Improved generalization** – Softer targets lower the training loss’s sensitivity to individual token errors, encouraging the model to capture broader patterns in the data. Empirically, Transformers trained with label smoothing often achieve higher BLEU scores on translation tasks.

3. **Calibration** – The output probabilities become better calibrated, meaning the predicted confidence better reflects true correctness. This is useful when the model is deployed in downstream systems that rely on probability estimates.

**Nuances & trade‑offs**

- **Optimal ε** – Too small, and the effect is negligible; too large, and the model may under‑fit, producing diffuse predictions that hurt perplexity.
- **Interaction with other regularizers** – Label smoothing often works best alongside dropout or weight decay; they jointly temper the network’s ability to memorize.
- **Training dynamics** – With softened targets, the cross‑entropy gradient is reduced for the correct token, leading to slightly slower convergence but smoother loss landscapes.

\frac{\varepsilon_{\rm ls}}{K-1} & \text{otherwise}

\]

**Effect on model performance**

* **Regularization & Calibration** – By preventing the network from assigning probability 1 to a single token, it acts as a Bayesian regularizer that mitigates over‑confidence. The model’s predictive distribution becomes closer to the true data distribution, improving uncertainty estimates.

* **Generalization & BLEU** – Empirically, Transformers with ε\_ls=0.1 show higher BLEU in MT tasks. The smoothed targets push the model to spread probability mass over plausible alternatives, reducing the risk of memorizing frequent tokens.

* **Decoding Interaction** – During beam search, smoother posteriors are less “peaky”; they make beam exploration more robust, avoiding sub‑optimal local maxima. This often translates to better hypothesis diversity.

* **Connection to Knowledge Distillation** – Smoothing can be interpreted as training against a soft teacher that averages over all classes, similar to distillation. It encourages the student to approximate the teacher’s marginal distribution, which is beneficial for low‑resource scenarios.

* **Theoretical Insight** – Label smoothing can be seen as minimizing an upper bound on the cross‑entropy that penalizes high mutual information between input and output. It biases the posterior toward a mixture of the target and a uniform prior, thus encouraging a smoother posterior manifold.

**Implications for the Transformer**

| Effect | Mechanism | Outcome |

| **Calibrated logits** | Soft targets lower the gradient magnitude for already‑confident predictions, reducing the pull toward over‑confidence. | Better probability calibration, fewer spurious high‑probability tokens. |
| **Improved generalisation** | Acts as a form of label‑noise injection, discouraging memorisation of idiosyncratic training patterns. | Lower perplexity on held‑out data and higher BLEU scores on translation tasks. |
| **Smoother gradients** | By spreading probability mass, the loss surface becomes less steep, helping the Adam optimiser avoid sharp minima. | Faster convergence and more stable training dynamics. |
| **Regularised entropy** | The loss penalises low‑entropy predictions, implicitly encouraging exploration of alternative decoding paths. | Enables beam‑search to discover higher‑quality hypotheses. |
| **Interaction with temperature** | Label smoothing is equivalent to adding a fixed temperature to the softmax during training; the same effect can be achieved by tuning temperature at inference. | Provides a bridge to knowledge‑distillation techniques and temperature‑scaled decoding. |

**Performance impact**

Empirically, the Transformer trained with \(\varepsilon_{ls}=0.1\) reported a BLEU boost of 0.5–1.0 points over hard‑target training on WMT datasets. The improvement is consistent across both small‑scale and large‑scale models, suggesting that the regularisation effect scales with capacity. Moreover, smoothing reduces the variance of the final loss, leading to more reproducible results across random seeds.

Label smoothing is a lightweight, mathematically principled regulariser that trades a tiny loss in maximum‑logit certainty for gains in calibration, generalisation, and optimisation stability.

For a K‑class output, each target is replaced with a mixture:  
- “correct” class: 1 − ε_ls,  
- “incorrect” classes: ε_ls ⁄ (K‑1).  

This modification has two intertwined effects:

1. **Regularisation & Reduced Over‑confidence** – By preventing the softmax from saturating at 1 for the true class, the optimiser is discouraged from pushing logits to extreme values. The model learns a smoother posterior, which empirically yields better generalisation on out‑of‑distribution data and higher BLEU scores in NMT settings.

2. **Implicit Entropy Maximisation** – The loss now favours predictions with higher entropy, implicitly encouraging the model to allocate probability mass to plausible alternatives. In Transformers, this translates into a more diverse attention distribution and better coverage of rare tokens, improving robustness to noise and vocabulary mismatches.

Trade‑offs:  
- A higher ε_ls can slightly lower training accuracy because the target becomes “soft”; however, this is compensated by reduced test‑time confidence gaps.  
- In very deep Transformers, too much smoothing can dampen gradients in the lower layers, leading to slower convergence unless compensated by higher learning rates or adaptive optimisers.

This provides additional non-linearity and capacity beyond the attention sub-layer.","Why does the Transformer apply a position-wise feed-forward network after the attention sub-layer, and how is it implemented?","**Why a feed‑forward network follows the attention step?**  
- **Adds extra non‑linearity.** Self‑attention mixes information across positions but it is essentially a linear operation on each token’s hidden vector. A feed‑forward network (FFN) introduces a second set of linear maps with a ReLU in between, creating a deeper nonlinear mapping that can capture more complex patterns.  
- **Increases capacity.** The two linear layers (often 2048 → 512 in BERT, for example) expand the dimensionality, giving the model more parameters to learn subtle relationships that pure attention cannot express.  
- **Per‑position processing.** Because the FFN is applied *independently* to every position, it can refine each token’s representation without further mixing information across positions. This keeps the structure simple while still providing powerful transformations.

**How it is implemented**  
For a token representation \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) (after attention and residual/normalization):

1. **First linear layer**:  
   \(h = xW_1 + b_1\),  where \(W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{\text{ff}}}\).  
2. **ReLU activation**:  
   \(a = \max(0, h)\).  
3. **Second linear layer**:  
   \(y = aW_2 + b_2\),  where \(W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}} \times d}\).  

The same \(W_1, b_1, W_2, b_2\) are used for every position in the sequence, but each layer in the transformer stack has its own set of these weights. The output \(y\) is then fed to the next sub‑layer (another residual and layer‑norm block).  

**Illustrative example**  
Suppose a 4‑dimensional hidden vector for a word is \([0.2, 0.5, -0.1, 0.3]\).  
- After the first linear transform (weights 4×8), we might get a 8‑dimensional vector.  
- ReLU zeroes out negative entries.  
- The second transform (8×4) brings it back to 4 dimensions, but now the values are a nonlinear recombination of the original features, ready for the next attention step.

   The multi‑head self‑attention mixes information across tokens but stays linear (after the soft‑max). A feed‑forward net introduces a second, independent non‑linear transformation that can combine the attended features in new ways. Think of attention as a “mixing” stage and the FFN as a “re‑calibration” stage.

2. **Keeps the model lightweight and parallelizable**  
   Because the same two linear layers are applied to every token, the FFN can be computed in parallel with a simple matrix multiplication, preserving the Transformer’s efficiency.

3. **Separates roles**  
   Attention rewires information spatially; the FFN processes each token’s representation locally, allowing the model to learn position‑specific transformations without cross‑token interactions.

### How it works

1. **Input**: a hidden‑state vector \(x\) for one token (size *d*).  
2. **First linear layer**: \(xW_1 + b_1\) (usually expands dimensionality, e.g., *d* → *4d*).  
3. **ReLU**: \(\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)\) turns negative values into zero, adding non‑linearity.  
4. **Second linear layer**: \((\text{ReLU}(z))W_2 + b_2\) (shrinks back to *d*).  

Mathematically:  
\[
\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0,\,xW_1 + b_1)\;W_2 + b_2
\]

This operation is **applied independently to each token**, so the model can process every position with the same transformation but still capture complex relationships thanks to the two linear steps and the ReLU in between.",2710

1. **Extra non‑linearity and capacity** – Self‑attention is linear in its outputs.  
   Adding a feed‑forward network (FFN) gives the model a second non‑linear transformation, which lets it capture more complex patterns that pure attention cannot.

2. **Independent processing per position** – The FFN operates on each token’s vector separately, so it can refine the representation at that position using the context it has already gathered.  
   This is useful for tasks where fine‑grained token‑level adjustments (e.g., adding a small bias) matter.

3. **Layer‑wise diversity** – The same FFN parameters are shared across all positions, but different layers use different parameters.  
   This gives each encoder/decoder layer its own “skill set” while keeping the model lightweight.

**How it is implemented**

For a hidden vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) coming out of the attention sub‑layer, the FFN applies two linear maps with a ReLU in between:

\[
\text{FFN}(x)=\max(0,\;xW_1+b_1)W_2+b_2
\]

- \(W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d_{\text{ff}}}\) expands the dimension to a larger hidden size \(d_{\text{ff}}\) (often 4× \(d\)).  
- ReLU introduces non‑linearity.  
- \(W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}}\times d}\) projects back to the model dimension.  
- Biases \(b_1, b_2\) are added after each linear map.

The same matrices \(W_1, W_2, b_1, b_2\) are applied to every token in the sequence, but each Transformer layer has its own set of these weights. This simple, position‑wise operation complements the global interactions learned by attention, boosting overall representational power.",4640

In a Transformer the attention sub‑layer produces, for each token, a contextualized vector that is a weighted mix of all other positions.  
The feed‑forward network (FFN) is applied *after* this mixing for two key reasons:

1. **Additive non‑linearity and extra capacity** – Self‑attention is linear in the query/key/value matrices. An MLP with a non‑linear activation (ReLU, GELU, etc.) injects a second source of non‑linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex, position‑specific transformations of the contextual vector.
2. **Position‑wise independence** – The same FFN is applied independently to every token. This preserves the per‑position nature of the representation while still expanding the dimensionality and enabling interactions among the hidden units within each token’s vector.

Thus the FFN increases expressive power without introducing new cross‑token dependencies.

**Implementation**

For every layer, each token’s representation \(x \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) is transformed by a two‑layer MLP with a ReLU between:

\[
\text{FFN}(x)=\max(0,\; xW_{1}+b_{1})\,W_{2}+b_{2},
\]

where \(W_{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_{\text{ff}}}\), \(W_{2}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}}\times d_{\text{model}}}\).  
\(d_{\text{ff}}\) is typically 4 × \(d_{\text{model}}\).  
Each layer uses its own \(W_{1},W_{2},b_{1},b_{2}\), but all tokens share the same parameters within that layer.

**Nuances**

* The FFN is *position‑wise*, so it doesn’t mix token positions—this keeps the attention’s global context separate from the local, non‑linear refinement.  
* Variants may replace ReLU with GELU or use depth‑wise separable convolutions for efficiency.  
* Layer‑norm is usually applied before the sub‑layer (pre‑norm) or after (post‑norm), but the core FFN remains unchanged.

In short, the FFN injects a second, independent non‑linear transformation that enhances representational capacity while keeping the per‑position processing structure intact.",5110

* **Complementary role** – Self‑attention lets each token look at every other token, capturing *relations* in the sequence. The feed‑forward network (FFN) then refines the representation of each token *independently*, adding extra non‑linearity and capacity that attention alone can’t provide.

* **Same‑shape transformation** – The FFN is applied to every position in the sequence in exactly the same way, so it does not change the alignment of tokens. It therefore preserves the positional structure while allowing each token’s embedding to be processed through a richer transformation.

* **Increased expressiveness** – The two linear layers with a ReLU in between give the model a larger “non‑linear space” to map token embeddings. This helps the Transformer learn complex patterns that attention alone might miss.

**Implementation**

For each token vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\):

1. **First linear transform**  
   \[
   z = xW_1 + b_1 \quad (W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d_{\text{ff}}},\; b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}}})

Attention aggregates information across all positions, producing a context‑aware vector for each token. The subsequent FFN then applies a *local* nonlinear transformation to each token’s context vector independently. This two‑stage design gives the model:

1. **Non‑linear capacity** – Attention is linear (aside from the soft‑max), so a non‑linear FFN is needed to increase representational power and model higher‑order interactions within each token’s representation.  
2. **Depth‑wise feature extraction** – The linear layers of the FFN can learn feature‑specific mappings (e.g., projecting to a higher‑dimensional space, then back) that are not tied to positional relationships, enabling the network to refine token‑level representations.  
3. **Parameter sharing across positions** – Since the same weights are applied to every position, the FFN does not grow with sequence length, keeping the parameter count manageable while still enriching each token’s representation.

**Implementation details**  
For each position *i* in a layer, the input vector \(x_i\) is transformed as:

\[
\text{FFN}(x_i) = \sigma(x_i W_1 + b_1)\, W_2 + b_2,\quad \sigma(z) = \max(0,z)

- ReLU introduces sparsity and non‑linearity.

All positions share \(W_1, b_1, W_2, b_2\) within the same layer but each layer has its own set of parameters. Residual connections and layer‑norm sandwich the sub‑layers to stabilize training.

Its role is two‑fold:

1. **Capacity & Non‑linearity** – Attention mixes information across positions but then produces a linear representation. The position‑wise FFN applies a second affine transform followed by a ReLU, giving each token its own non‑linear feature mapping. This adds depth and expressive power beyond the single attention pass, allowing the model to learn complex interactions that cannot be captured by attention alone.

2. **Modularity & Efficiency** – Since the same linear layers are shared across all tokens, the FFN introduces no positional cross‑talk, keeping the computational pattern identical to that of the attention sub‑layer. It also keeps the per‑token cost \(O(d_{\text{ff}})\) (where \(d_{\text{ff}}\) is usually \(4d_{\text{model}}\)) while adding only a small constant number of parameters per layer.

**Implementation**

\[

The same \(W_1, W_2, b_1, b_2\) are applied to every position in the sequence, but each Transformer layer uses its own set of parameters, giving the model depth‑wise heterogeneity.

**Nuances & Variants**

- The feed‑forward can be replaced by depth‑wise convolutions (e.g., in gMLP) or gated linear units for improved expressiveness.
- Position‑wise FFNs contribute to the “feed‑forward layer” cost in training and inference; efficient implementations use fused kernels or 1‑D convolutions with kernel size 1 to exploit GPU SIMD.
- In the original Vaswani et al. paper, the residual connection and LayerNorm are applied *before* the FFN, preserving the identity path and stabilizing training.

A Transformer starts with an input representation (e.g., word embeddings).  
For every head we compute three vectors—*query*, *key*, and *value*—from that same input.  
Instead of feeding the raw input to all heads, the model applies a **learned linear
projection** to each of the three components:

\[
q = XW^{Q}_h,\;\; k = XW^{K}_h,\;\; v = XW^{V}_h
\]

* \(X\) is the input matrix.  
* \(W^{Q}_h, W^{K}_h, W^{V}_h\) are weight matrices specific to head \(h\).  
* The dimensions \(d_k\) and \(d_v\) can be smaller than the input size, giving each head its own “subspace.”

**How this enhances modeling power**

1. **Diversification of focus** – Because each head has its own projection matrices, it learns to emphasize different patterns (e.g., syntax vs. semantics).  
2. **Avoids averaging** – A single head would average over all patterns, losing nuance. Multiple heads keep distinct signals separate until the final merge.  
3. **Efficient representation** – Projecting to a lower‑dimensional subspace reduces computation while still capturing essential information.  
4. **Rich interaction** – After individual heads compute their attention, the concatenated outputs are linearly projected again, allowing the model to recombine the diverse insights into a unified representation.

**Simple illustration**  
Imagine a sentence “The quick brown fox.”  
* Head 1 might learn to align each word with its grammatical role (subject, adjective, noun).  
* Head 2 could focus on semantic similarity (e.g., “quick” and “fast”).  
The projections let each head develop its own “lens,” and the final merge stitches these lenses into a stronger overall understanding.

In multi‑head attention each head is a small “instance” of a dot‑product attention.  
The model first projects the input vectors \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) into three subspaces:

\[
Q = xW_Q,\qquad K = xW_K,\qquad V = xW_V ,
\]

where \(W_Q,W_K,W_V\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_k}\) (and \(d_v\)).  
These learnable matrices serve several purposes:

1. **Sub‑space specialization** – By learning distinct projection weights, each head can focus on a particular “aspect” of the token (syntax, semantics, positional cues, etc.).  
2. **Dimensionality reduction** – Reducing from \(d_{\text{model}}\) to \(d_k\) lowers the cost of the \(O(n^2d_k)\) attention matrix while preserving enough capacity for the head’s task.  
3. **Expressive power** – The linear mapping is a universal approximator for feature extraction; it allows the model to weight different input dimensions differently for each head, effectively performing a learned feature transformation before similarity calculation.  
4. **Ensemble effect** – The outputs of all heads are concatenated and passed through a final projection \(W_O\). This merges the diverse sub‑space representations, enabling the network to learn cross‑head interactions that a single head cannot capture.

**Modeling‑power enhancement**

- *Multi‑faceted attention*: Each head can capture a different type of relationship (e.g., local vs. global, syntactic vs. semantic).  
- *Efficient parallelism*: Heads run concurrently, so the added capacity doesn’t inflate the sequential runtime.  
- *Regularization through orthogonality*: In practice, heads often learn near‑orthogonal projections, reducing redundancy and improving generalization.  
- *Flexibility*: The same architecture works across modalities and sequence lengths because the projections are learned from data rather than hard‑coded.

In a Transformer each head must look at a different “view” of the same token sequence.  
To let a head focus on a particular pattern, the model learns three small weight matrices:

* **Q (query)** – tells the head *what* it is looking for.  
* **K (key)** – stores the *features* of every token that other queries can compare against.  
* **V (value)** – holds the actual information that will be passed forward.

The learned linear projections (matrices) map the high‑dimensional token embeddings into three separate sub‑spaces of sizes \(d_k\) and \(d_v\). Because each head learns its own projection matrices, the representations it produces differ: one head might learn to attend to syntax, another to semantics, another to position‑based cues, etc.

**How this boosts modelling power**

1. **Parallel diversity** – multiple heads extract complementary information simultaneously, so the model can capture many relationships at once.  
2. **Dimensionality reduction** – projecting to smaller sub‑spaces reduces the cost of the dot‑product, making attention cheaper while preserving enough capacity for each head.  
3. **Learned specialization** – the gradients drive each head’s projection to specialize; the final concatenation and a second projection fuse these diverse views into a richer representation.

- In a Transformer the same input word is turned into three different kinds of numbers: **query**, **key**, and **value**.  
- The model does this with three little math rules:  
  *Query = input × W_Q,*  
  *Key = input × W_K,*  
  *Value = input × W_V.*  
  Here *W_Q, W_K, W_V* are small tables of numbers that the network learns while training.  
- “Linear transformation” simply means “multiply by a matrix.” The matrices are not fixed; the network adjusts them so each head can look at the input in its own way.

**How does this help the model?**  
1. **Different views** – Each head learns its own set of matrices, so it can focus on different patterns (e.g., word order, word meaning).  
2. **Parallel exploration** – All heads work at the same time, each spotting a distinct relationship.  
3. **Rich output** – The outputs from all heads are stitched together and turned into a final vector. This combined vector carries information from many angles, making the model more expressive.  
4. **Efficient learning** – Because the matrices are learned, the network automatically finds the best way to split the input, rather than being forced to use a single, fixed view.

They serve three intertwined purposes:

1. **Dimensionality reduction and conditioning** – Each head operates in a \(d_k\) or \(d_v\)‑dimensional latent subspace. By learning the projection, the model can reshape the raw token embeddings into a space that is most useful for that head’s relational task (e.g., syntax, semantics, or positional patterns).

2. **Specialization of heads** – Different heads learn different linear combinations of the input features. This yields orthogonal or complementary subspaces, enabling the self‑attention mechanism to jointly attend to several types of relationships (dependency, co‑occurrence, structural cues) that would be conflated in a single head.

3. **Parameter efficiency and regularization** – Reducing the dimensionality per head keeps the dot‑product complexity linear in \(d_k\). The concatenation and final linear projection recombine the diverse information while controlling the parameter budget. This mitigates overfitting compared to using the full embedding dimension in every head.

In multi‑head attention each head has its own set of weight matrices  
\(W_Q, W_K, W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_k}\) (for queries, keys, values).  
These matrices are *learned* so that the model can determine, from data, the most useful linear combinations of the input vectors that expose the relationships it needs to attend to.

**What does this buy the model?**  

1. **Sub‑space specialization** – By projecting to a lower‑dimensional sub‑space (\(d_k < d_{\text{model}}\)), each head can focus on a distinct representation of the same token (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic cues). The learned weights decide which directions in the original embedding space are most informative for a given head.

2. **Parameter efficiency** – The projections reduce the dimensionality of the dot‑product computation, keeping the computational cost linear in \(d_{\text{model}}\) while still allowing \(H\) parallel heads. The final concatenation‑then‑projection step restores the full dimensionality, so no information is lost, only reorganized.

3. **Expressive power** – The combined effect of many learned projections is equivalent to a high‑order polynomial kernel in the original feature space. Each head can discover a different “attention rule” (e.g., long‑range, positional, or syntactic), and the concatenated outputs let the subsequent layers mix these signals arbitrarily.

4. **Flexibility over fixed heads** – Had the projections been fixed (e.g., identity or random), the heads would be limited to predetermined sub‑spaces. Learned weights allow the model to adaptively choose which aspects of the input are most useful for each head, improving generalization to varied tasks.

**Bottom line**  
Learned linear transformations give each attention head a unique, data‑driven viewpoint. By projecting queries, keys, and values into different learned sub‑spaces, the Transformer can capture a richer set of relationships among tokens, all while keeping the overall computation tractable.",5110

**Why projection?**  
* **Expressive sub‑spaces** – By learning distinct weight matrices, each head can attend to a different pattern (e.g., syntactic dependencies, semantic roles, or positional cues).  
* **Dimensionality control** – Splitting the total dimension \(d_{\text{model}}\) into \(h\) heads of size \(d_k\) keeps per‑head computation tractable while still allowing the full model to aggregate rich information.  
* **Parameter efficiency** – A single set of learned weights replaces hard‑coded attention masks, letting the network adaptively discover which aspects of the input matter for each head.  

**How it boosts modeling power**  
1. **Parallel, diverse views** – Each head processes a distinct representation; the concatenation of all heads gives a richer joint representation than a single head could.  
2. **Implicit regularization** – Sharing the same projection matrices across heads (but different output projections) constrains the solution space, reducing overfitting.  
3. **Scalable attention** – With \(h\) heads of size \(d_k\), the self‑attention complexity is \(O(n^2d_k)\), lower than using a single head with dimension \(d_{\text{model}}\).  

**Example**: In machine translation, one head might learn to focus on word order (positional patterns), while another captures long‑range semantic agreement. Their combined outputs give the decoder a more nuanced context for generating the target sentence.

1. **Subspace specialization** – Each head learns a unique basis, allowing the dot‑product in that subspace to focus on a particular relational pattern (syntax, semantics, positional bias, etc.).

2. **Computational efficiency and expressiveness** – Dimensionality reduction (typically \(d_k, d_v < d_{\text{model}}\)) keeps the per‑head attention cost linear in sequence length while preserving a large overall capacity.

**Why linear projections?**  
- **Subspace factorization:** Each head maps the input embedding into a lower‑dimensional subspace (\(d_k, d_v\)), allowing the model to learn independent representations of the same token in different feature spaces.  
- **Parameter sharing vs. diversity:** While all heads share the same overall architecture, their projection weights are distinct, giving each head a unique “lens” on the input. This diversity captures multiple relational patterns (syntax, semantics, positional dependencies) that a single linear map would mix together.  
- **Computational efficiency:** Linear transformations are cheap to compute and can be parallelized across heads, enabling the model to attend to several patterns simultaneously without the quadratic cost of a full‑rank coupling matrix.  

**How does it enhance modelling power?**  
- **Increased expressiveness:** With \(H\) heads each having its own \(d_k\)-dimensional space, the effective representation capacity grows roughly by a factor of \(H\), enabling the network to encode more nuanced interactions while keeping each head’s dimensionality manageable.  
- **Regularization through decomposition:** The factorization into multiple linear maps acts as a structured form of parameter sharing that mitigates over‑parameterization relative to a single large projection.  
- **Enabling richer attention scores:** The dot‑product \(QK^\top\) in each head produces distinct similarity patterns; concatenating these results yields a composite attention distribution that is more sensitive to diverse contextual cues.

1. **Subspace disentanglement** – By projecting the shared token embeddings into distinct \(d_k\)‑ and \(d_v\)‑dimensional subspaces, each head can specialise on a different relational pattern (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic dependencies). The orthogonality or near‑orthogonality of these subspaces is not enforced but is learned implicitly, granting the model a richer joint representation than a single‑head attention.

2. **Parameter‑efficient expressivity** – Linear projections are the minimal sufficient statistics for the dot‑product attention mechanism. They allow the network to learn a dense weight matrix that can rotate and scale the embedding space, capturing complex interactions while keeping the parameter count linear in \(d\). This balances expressivity with tractability, enabling gradient‑based optimisation to focus on salient sub‑patterns.

3. **Dimensionality reduction and regularisation** – Projecting to \(d_k < d\) reduces the computational load (the softmax matrix is \(d_k\times d_k\)) and serves as a form of implicit regularisation, forcing each head to compress information into a compact representation that still preserves necessary semantics.

4. **Modularity for fusion** – After attention, the concatenated head outputs are linearly recomposed by \(W^O\). This second projection acts as a learned aggregator, allowing the model to weight each head’s contribution adaptively, akin to attention‑within‑attention.

Adam blends two ideas that help the Transformer train quickly and stably:  

| What it does | Why it matters | Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Momentum (β₁ ≈ 0.9)** | Keeps a smoothed version of the gradient so that noisy updates are dampened. | If a word embedding gradient flips sign between steps, the moving average will still point in the overall direction. |
| **Adaptive variance (β₂ ≈ 0.98)** | Tracks the average of squared gradients, letting each weight have its own learning‑rate scale. | Parameters that change a lot (e.g., attention weights) get a smaller effective step, while stable ones get larger. |
| **Numerical safety (ε = 10⁻⁹)** | Prevents division by zero when the variance estimate is tiny. | If a gradient is almost zero, the denominator stays finite. |

**Learning‑rate schedule (warm‑up + decay)**  
The formula  

```
lrate = d_model^(-0.5) * min(step^(-0.5), step * warmup⁻¹·⁵)
```

does two things:

1. **Warm‑up (first 4000 steps)** – The learning rate grows linearly (`step * warmup⁻¹·⁵`).  
   *Why?* Early in training the gradients are huge and noisy; a tiny step keeps the model from overshooting and destabilizing.

2. **Decay (after warm‑up)** – The rate falls as `step^(-0.5)`.  
   *Why?* Once the model is in a good region, smaller steps help fine‑tune weights and avoid oscillation around a minimum.

The factor `d_model^(-0.5)` scales the whole schedule inversely with the model size, so larger models start with a proportionally smaller step, keeping the updates balanced.

**Impact on convergence**  
- **Stability:** Momentum and adaptive variance reduce oscillations; warm‑up prevents early divergence.  
- **Speed:** Once past warm‑up, the schedule lets the model take larger steps than a fixed small lr would, accelerating progress.  
- **Fine‑tuning:** The inverse‑sqrt decay gives the model enough time to hone in on a good solution without getting stuck in noisy gradients.

The Transformer relies on Adam because it estimates first‑moment (m) and second‑moment (v) statistics of the gradients, effectively performing RMSProp with momentum.  
* **β₁ = 0.9** gives a good balance between following the mean gradient direction and smoothing rapid changes—important for the highly non‑convex transformer objective.  
* **β₂ = 0.98** is higher than the typical 0.999; this reduces the variance of the second‑moment estimate, yielding more stable updates in the presence of the dense self‑attention matrix.  
* **ε = 1e‑9** is tiny enough to avoid biasing the update when gradients are small, yet prevents division‑by‑zero when both m and v are near zero.

The learning‑rate schedule  
lrate = d_model^(-0.5) · min(step⁻⁰⋅⁵, step·warmup⁻¹⋅⁵) with **warmup_steps = 4000** is a two‑phase scheme:

1. **Linear warm‑up** (step < 4000): lrate grows as step·4000⁻¹⋅⁵. This caps the initial updates, allowing the optimizer to stabilize the large number of attention parameters before the gradients explode.
2. **Inverse‑sqrt decay** (step ≥ 4000): lrate falls as step⁻⁰⋅⁵, ensuring a gradual, theoretically grounded reduction that matches the diminishing returns of the learning process.

*Impact on convergence*:  
* The warm‑up mitigates early divergence in the first 4 k steps, critical for deep models where gradients can be very large.  
* The decay guarantees that the step size shrinks in a controlled way, preventing oscillations once the model nears a minimum.  
* Combined with Adam’s adaptive moments, the schedule ensures stable training across all layers, yielding faster convergence and better final performance.

**Trade‑offs**:  
* A higher β₂ may slow adaptation to sudden gradient shifts, while too small ε can still cause numerical instability on very sparse gradients.  
* Warm‑up steps are a hyperparameter that must be tuned to the model size (d_model); too few steps can lead to early collapse, too many can slow initial progress.

1. **What is Adam?**  
   Adam is a way to move the model’s parameters (the “weights”) during learning.  
   * **Momentum** (β₁ = 0.9) keeps a running memory of past gradient directions, so the updates are smoother and don’t jump around.  
   * **Variance adaptation** (β₂ = 0.98) remembers how large past gradients were, so the size of each step can shrink when gradients are big and grow when they’re small.  
   * **ε = 10⁻⁹** is a tiny number added so we never divide by zero.

   Think of it like walking: β₁ is the habit of walking in the same direction, β₂ is how fast you adjust your stride when the ground is rough.

2. **Learning‑rate schedule**  
   *The formula*:  
   `lrate = d_model⁻⁰·⁵ * min(step⁻⁰·⁵, step * warmup⁻¹·⁵)` with `warmup = 4000`.  
   * **Linear warm‑up** (first 4000 steps): the learning rate grows from 0 to its peak. This gives the model time to settle before making large updates, preventing the weights from exploding.  
   * **Inverse‑sqrt decay** (after 4000 steps): the rate slowly shrinks as training progresses, allowing fine‑tuning without overshooting.

3. **Impact on convergence**  
   * The momentum and variance terms keep updates stable, especially for the Transformer’s many layers.  
   * The warm‑up lets the model start safely, then the decay keeps it from taking big steps that would throw it off track.  
   * Together, they help the loss drop quickly at first, then plateau smoothly, giving reliable training and a model that generalizes well.

- **Adam** is a way to “step” the model’s weights during training.  
  * It remembers how the weights were moving before (past gradients) so that it can take smart, small steps when the direction is uncertain and bigger steps when the direction is clear.  
  * Think of it as a driver who remembers how a road has turned before and uses that memory to decide how fast to go.

- **Why the specific hyper‑parameters?**

  * **β₂ = 0.98** – keeps a very long‑term memory of the size of gradients.  
  * **ε = 10⁻⁹** – a tiny number added to the denominator so we never divide by zero; it keeps the update stable when gradients are very small.  

- **Learning‑rate schedule**  
  * The formula `lrate = d_model^(-0.5) * min(step_num^(-0.5), step_num * warmup_steps^(-1.5))` does two things:  
    1. **Warm‑up (first 4,000 steps)** – the learning rate grows linearly. This is like slowly turning up the volume so the model doesn’t jump too hard at the start.  
    2. **After warm‑up** – the rate falls as `1/√step_num`. It’s like gradually easing the volume so the model fine‑tunes itself.  

- **Impact on convergence**  
  * Early on, the linear warm‑up lets the model learn basic patterns without crashing.  
  * The decay after warm‑up prevents the weights from overshooting as training progresses, letting the model settle into a good solution.

The schedule

- **β₁** controls the exponential moving average of gradients (momentum). A value of 0.9 keeps most of the recent gradient direction while dampening noise, which is crucial for the self‑attention layers that generate highly correlated updates.  
- **β₂** sets the moving average of squared gradients. 0.98 gives a long‑term view of variance, making the effective step‑size more conservative in later stages and preventing premature spikes that could destabilise the large‑scale attention parameters.

**Why ε = 10⁻⁹?**  
The tiny epsilon regularises division by the root‑mean‑square of gradients, avoiding division by zero when gradients vanish in early layers. The smaller value compared to typical 10⁻⁶ keeps the effective learning rate larger, which complements the warm‑up schedule.

**Learning‑rate schedule**  
\(lrate = d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5}\, \min(\text{step}^{-0.5},\, \text{step}\cdot \text{warmup}^{-1.5})\)

- The **warm‑up** (4000 steps) linearly increases the learning rate to give the optimiser enough momentum to escape the initial saddle point.  
- After warm‑up, the \( \text{step}^{-0.5}\) decay tempers the step size as the optimiser refines the parameters, matching the theory that a decreasing step size is necessary for convergence in stochastic optimisation.

  \[
  \alpha_t = \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon},
  \]

with warmup_steps = 4000:

1. **Linear warm‑up** for the first 4000 steps – the learning rate rises from near 0 to its peak. This lets the network’s weights settle from the random initialization before large updates occur, reducing the risk of divergence.  
2. **Inverse‑sqrt decay** thereafter – as training progresses, the step number grows and the learning rate shrinks like 1/√t. This keeps the updates small enough to fine‑tune without overshooting minima, while still allowing exploration early on.

**Impact on convergence**  
* The warm‑up gives the optimizer a “safe” start, avoiding the catastrophic spikes that can happen when all parameters are updated aggressively at t = 0.  
* The scaling by \(d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5}\) normalizes the magnitude of the gradient across models of different sizes, keeping the effective step consistent.  
* The adaptive per‑parameter rates smooth out the noise inherent in stochastic mini‑batch gradients, especially important in the multi‑attention heads where different heads may learn at different speeds.

In short, the specific Adam hyperparameters together with the warm‑up + inverse‑sqrt schedule provide a mathematically principled, empirically effective training rhythm that accelerates convergence, stabilizes the residual‑connection‑heavy architecture, and mitigates early‑stage instability.",6010

The **Adam optimizer** is a popular choice because it

1. **Keeps a running average of past gradients** (the “momentum” part, β₁ = 0.9).  
   – Think of it as a smooth‑pedal: you don’t change direction too quickly, so updates stay stable.

2. **Keeps a running average of the squared gradients** (β₂ = 0.98).  
   – This tells Adam how big the gradient “pulses” usually are. If a direction changes a lot, Adam automatically shrinks the step size in that direction.

3. **Adds a tiny ε = 10⁻⁹** to avoid dividing by zero.  
   – Like a safety margin so the algorithm never stalls.

4. **Uses a learning‑rate schedule**:  
   `lrate = d_model⁻⁰·⁵ × min(step⁻⁰·⁵, step × warmup⁻¹·⁵)`.  
   – Initially the rate grows linearly for the first 4 000 steps (the “warm‑up”).  
   – After warm‑up, it shrinks roughly with 1/√step, which lets the model take smaller, more precise steps as it gets closer to a solution.

**Impact on convergence**

- **Early training**: The warm‑up lets the model explore without blowing up gradients.  
- **Adaptive scaling**: Adam’s two momentum terms mean each weight gets its own step size; weights that see noisy updates get smaller steps, while smooth ones can move faster.  
- **Stability**: The schedule and ε prevent oscillations and ensure the loss decreases steadily.

Overall, these settings let the Transformer learn quickly at first, then fine‑tune gradually, which is why it converges reliably on large‑scale language tasks.",6730

* **β₁ = 0.9** keeps the first‑moment estimate close to the usual exponential moving average used in SGD‑momentum, allowing the optimizer to follow the main descent direction.  
* **β₂ = 0.98** gives the second‑moment estimate a long memory, effectively dampening the impact of transient spikes in gradient norms that arise from self‑attention and large batch sizes.  
* **ε = 10⁻⁹** is smaller than the 10⁻⁶ often used, permitting more aggressive scaling of the update when the second‑moment is tiny, which is common in the early layers of the encoder‑decoder stack.

The learning‑rate schedule,  
\( \text{lrate}=d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5}\,\min(\text{step}^{-0.5},\text{step}\,\,4000^{-1.5})\),  
provides a linear warm‑up that counteracts the bias‑correction issue in Adam’s early steps (where variance is high) and a subsequent inverse‑sqrt decay that keeps the step size commensurate with the diminishing gradient magnitudes as the model approaches a local optimum.  

Together, these hyperparameters yield:

1. **Fast, stable convergence**: Warm‑up prevents catastrophic updates that could destabilize self‑attention weights; the decay tail keeps the optimizer in a fine‑tuning regime.  
2. **Reduced sensitivity to initialization**: Adam’s adaptive scaling obviates the need for tedious learning‑rate tuning that would otherwise be required for SGD on such deep architectures.  
3. **Scalability**: The same schedule and hyperparameter set work across model sizes (e.g., BERT‑BASE vs. LARGE) because the dimensionality‑dependent factor \(d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5}\) normalizes the initial step size.

In short, Adam with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.98, ε = 10⁻⁹ and the warm‑up/inverse‑sqrt schedule strikes a practical compromise between aggressive exploration and cautious exploitation, which is essential for the complex, high‑dimensional loss landscapes encountered in Transformers.",7520

**β₁ = 0.9** gives a long‑term momentum that damps oscillations without overly smoothing the directionality of the gradients. **β₂ = 0.98** keeps the second‑moment estimate very sluggish, which is useful when the model sees highly correlated, sparse updates (e.g., attention‑softmax masks). The tiny **ε = 10⁻⁹** stabilises division for nearly zero second‑moment values, allowing a very fine‑grained step‑size control without exploding updates.  

The learning‑rate schedule  

\[
\text{lrate}=d_{\text{model}}^{-0.5}\,\min\left(step^{-0.5},\,\frac{step}{\text{warmup}^{1.5}}\right)
\]

with **warmup_steps = 4000** first increases the rate linearly, giving the optimiser a chance to “wake up” the vast number of parameters and avoid early‑stage gradient explosion. After the warm‑up the inverse‑square‑root decay keeps the step size proportional to the gradient‑noise level, which empirically matches the diminishing curvature of the loss surface during fine‑tuning.  

Together, the hyperparameters yield a stable, aggressively exploratory phase that quickly moves the weights into a region of low curvature, followed by a measured, noise‑aware descent that promotes convergence to a good minimum. Adjusting β₂ lower would make the step‑size too reactive; raising ε would blunt the adaptivity. Thus, the chosen values are a practical compromise that balances robustness, speed, and the delicate dynamics of training deep Transformer stacks.",9840
